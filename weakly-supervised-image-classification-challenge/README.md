# Kaggle Competition: AI Label Classification

## Introduction

This repository showcases my participation in a Kaggle competition hosted by École Polytechnique involving the classification of AI-generated labels into 48 distinct classes. The primary goal of the competition was to develop effective models for accurate label classification.

## Competition Overview

### Task
The main task of the competition was to classify AI-generated labels into one of 48 different classes.

### Data
The dataset provided for the competition included labeled examples of AI-generated labels. The labels needed to be classified into the predefined set of 48 classes.

## Repository Contents

### 1. Main.ipynb
The `Main.ipynb` file contains my solution to the competition task. This Jupyter Notebook encompasses the entire pipeline, from data preprocessing and model development to evaluation and results analysis. It serves as the central hub for understanding the approach taken and the implementation details.

### 2. Baseline
The repository includes the initial baseline provided by the competition organizers. This baseline serves as a reference point and a starting place for participants to build upon.

### 3. Results.pdf
The `Results.pdf` document comprehensively explains the methods implemented, details the steps taken during the competition, and presents the results obtained. This document provides insights into the strategies employed, challenges faced, and the overall performance of the developed solution.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to express my gratitude to Pr. Kalogeiton, Pr. Dufour and Pr. Vanier for organizing this Kaggle competition and providing an opportunity to explore and apply machine learning techniques to real-world problems.
