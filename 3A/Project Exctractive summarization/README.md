# Project Name

**JupyterNotebooks for Training Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and Classic Machine Learning Models**

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.10 or a more recent version installed on your system.

## Installation

```bash
pip install torch
pip install torch_geometric
pip install sklearn
```

## Usage

Execute the cells sequentially. Make sure your data follows the same format as the baseline. To replicate the results, hyperparameter tuning may be necessary, as we experimented with various settings. Unfortunately, we haven't documented the best hyperparameters, but the provided code closely resembles our most successful submissions.
